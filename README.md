# Introduction

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. It plays a significant role in self-driving cars, robotics, and photo correction apps. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library mainly aimed at real-time computer vision and image processing. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel).

Nowadays, the use of AI has a broad area which is facialiated by the openCV. The openCV can be used for the object detection and face recognition in real time based.  Besides face recognition and object recognition, there are lots of applications that are solved using OpenCV. Some of them are automated inspection and surveillance such as vehicle counting on highways along with their speeds,  anomaly (defect) detection in the manufacturing process (the odd defective products), interactive art installations, video/image search and retrieval, robot and driver-less car navigation and control, medical image analysis, Movies – 3D structure from motion, TV Channels advertisement recognition, motion understanding, structure form motion, augmented reality, boosting , decision tree learning, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), etc. Here, we will discuss about face recognition and object detection below:

# Object Detection

Object Detection is a computer technology related to computer vision, image processing, and deep learning that deals with detecting instances of objects in images and videos. Here, we have detected the object using a haar cascades.

## Haar Cascades 

Haar Cascade classifiers are an effective way for object detection. This method was proposed by Paul Vioala and Michael Jones in their paper Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features. Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negativev are used to train the classifier.
