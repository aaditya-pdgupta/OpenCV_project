# Introduction

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. It plays a significant role in self-driving cars, robotics, and photo correction apps. OpenCV is an open-source library mainly aimed at real-time computer vision and image processing.
